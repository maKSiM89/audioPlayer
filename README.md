<h1>AudioPlayer with HTML5 and Angular 1.5.9</h1>
<span>Version 1.0.0<span>


<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
    This player uses <i>audio</i> tags for creating audio DOM objects
    Playlist service stores blob URLs for file-like objects which user can upload.
    There is no server-side part so files don't stored anywhere and you should upload them after each page reloading
</p>

<strong>TODO:</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Assing uploading process to real database f.e. Firebase</li>
    <li>Add few playlists functionality</li>
    <li>Add suposting for IE8+</li>
    <li>Use one shared config in playlistService for stored the states of active track.
</ol>

Note:
- This player can't play two songs simultaneously but this can be done for a short time.
- Desing is not professional :)

Listen to the cool music!
